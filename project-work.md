## Project work process

Ideally at the start of the week, let one of the technical coaches know that you want to take part in the project work. Self assess for the [core developer skills](https://github.com/makers-projects/guide/skills) and send your assessment to the technical coach then discuss with them what you'd like to get out of the week and how much time you have to commit.

Once you've had this chat, pick up a ticket to work on. You may be balancing this with other work but ideally you will pick up a ticket that you are committed to finishing. In the process of taking on a ticket you should:

- Write up a short summary of your approach, including the things you think you need to know to do the ticket and how confident you are with each of these. 
- Log any problems that you encounter as you take on the ticket and your approach to solving them. Refer to the [problem solving guide](https://github.com/makers-projects/guide/skills/problem-solving) for help.
- Escalate any problems you are unable to solve to a coach. See [coach whereabouts](https://github.com/makers-projects/coach-whereabouts.md) for more information regards who to contact and when.
- When you think you have finished a ticket, write a summary of how you think this went and request a coach review.

A technical coach may occasionally check in on progress but otherwise you are expected to manage your own time and own any work that you take on.
