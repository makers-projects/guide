## Other Technical Coaches

You'll be familiar with the rest of the coaching staff from your time on the course. They are also (usually!) happy to help. You'll find them on the 3rd floor in the mornings between 10 and 12.30, available to take questions. 

Students actively engaged in the course currently take priority, so please be considerate of their time - if you think your question is likely to take more than 5 or 10 minutes, consider booking in some time in advance with one of the graduate coaches above.
