#Problem: I don't understand the problem context

## Examples
My database is not in the state I expect it to be. I want to debug but I don't understand how migrations work.
I am trying to write a component in React but it is not appearing on the page. I don't really understand how the React app works.

## Techniques
The techniques below help you to build a better mental model of the problem space, either through archaeology or visualisation. A good process to follow might be:

### Write some code!

### Map the problem
Mapping the problem involves producing a representation of it. This usually involves diagramming and language. At the end of this process, you should have a model, however high level, of the problem area. You should then be able to identify which bits of the model you think you understand and which bits of the model require more research.

### Research
It's better to research a problem once you've already taken on the step of mapping it out - and once you've done some research, try to map it out again. After you've mapped out the problem, trying writing a list of questions that you want to answer and after you have answered each one, update your model.

### Reduce scope
NB: sometimes only possible once you've done the above

"I don't know how X works" often isn't a good problem definition. For example, many students often express a desire to understand "How spring works" or "How React works" but the scope of these questions is pretty big. Better questions are "How does Spring route requests to the controller?" or "How does JSX get compiled in a React app?".

The more specific the scope of the question, the easier it will be for you to map and the easier it will be for you to look for answers.

### Pair with somebody
Working on something with somebody else can help you develop a shared understanding of a problem. 

### Whiteboard session
Documenting a shared understanding of a problem space with a peer or a coach can be a really powerful way of solidifying a mental model.
