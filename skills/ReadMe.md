# Developer Skills

## Overview

There are various different ways to divide skills. Here, we've conceived of them in 6 broad categories:

Key skills
- Core skills
- Code literacy
- Problem solving

Development skills
- Technical understanding
- Technical application
- Technical knowledge

An explanation of each of these sections is below. Where should you start, though? 

The key skills are labelled such because, if you can nail them, then the development skills will come with time. Conversely, if you're struggling with problem solving or code literacy, then time spent trying to learn another language is likely to be wasted. 


## Skills in detail

### Core Skills

- Growth mentality
- Time managament
- How to learn

### Code Literacy 

Examples:
- How well do you understand code concepts?

### Problem Solving
- How well can you describe a problem?
- Can you identify the root cause of a problem?
- Do you have a systematic approach for solving problems?
