# Technical Development for Makers Graduates

Congratulations! You've finished the course. Now for the hard bit...

## What do I next?

Start with [project work guide](https://github.com/makers-projects/skills) and do a self assessment as to where you most think you need to work. Use the guides linked from each of the skills category to find suggestsions for the kind of thing that you could be doing to upskill in each area.

If you're still unsure, talk to one of the [coaches](https://github.com/coach-whereabouts.md).

## Technical Development

## Project Work

Projects can provide a great, goal-focussed environment for learning. However, they can also be difficult to manage around job-seeking commitments. If you'd like to get involved with project work, do a [skills self assessment](https://github.com/makers-projects/skills) and then speak to one of the technical coaches regards where you think you should be focussing your attention.

See the [project work guide](https://github.com/makers-projects/project-work.md) for more information on how this works.
